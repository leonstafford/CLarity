# CLarity

Real-time visualization, monitoring and testing of disjunct services and digital assets  

## Use case for CLarity

**As** someone in an organisation with a multitude of applications, services and digital assets,

**I want to** be able to glance at a dashboard and see the health of all systems,

**So that** I can either relax or take action.   

### CLarity roadmap

 - [] top-level view of all resources, showing health status
 - [] load resources from easily editable text files
 - [] create and edit resources from GUI
 - [] drill-down to lower-level views of resource groups/resources
 - [] allow defining tests for resource types and specific resources
 - [] fullscreen dashboard view for at a glance monitoring

### Why CLarity?

The `CL` in CLarity is a shout-out to the [Tcl (Tool Command Language)](https://tcl.tk/)  programming language used in the project. 

### Why Tcl/Tk?

I chose Tcl and its Tk GUI extension for several reasons:

 - cross-platform portability, especially OpenBSD
 - lightweight
 - purported benefits in rapid prototyping and automated testing
 - to keep life interesting and learn some useful tools
